# Pantry Share Read Me


## Summary
Pantry Share provides a platform where users can find information on where they can access food and enables those with excess resources to share with others in a simple and convenient way. Users seeking resources will see a list of food banks and a map corresponding to the locations. Users will also see data generated by other users and have the opportunity to claim food. Users with excess resources can make new food posts.

## Technologies Used
- Google Maps API - to generate a map on our website
- Google Geocode API - to translate address data to lat and long and place markers on map
- Firebase Database - to store user generated data
- uikit - for styles and elements on the page
- JQuery - to build a responsive site and create HTML elements
- HTML - to create elements
- CSS - to style elements beyond uikit
- GIT - version control system to track changes to source code
- GitHUB - hosts repository that can be deployed in GitHUB pages

## Code Snippet

Our website relies on google maps to show map data to our users. This was a key functionality identified in the ideation process.

```
function initMap() {
  console.log("you made it");
// set initial orientation and magnification of map
  var map = new google.maps.Map(document.getElementById('map'), {
    zoom: 11,
  });

  // put the geocoder function into memory
  var geocoder = new google.maps.Geocoder();

  geocodeAddress(geocoder, map);

  // get addresses from foodpantries object and add them to the map
  function geocodeAddress(geocoder, resultsMap) {
    for (let i = 1; i < foodpantries.length; i++) {
      address = foodpantries[i].address
      geocoder.geocode({ 'address': address }, function (results, status) {
        if (status === 'OK') {
          resultsMap.setCenter(results[0].geometry.location);
          var marker = new google.maps.Marker({
            map: resultsMap,
            position: results[0].geometry.location
          });
        } else {
          alert('Geocode was not successful for the following reason: ' + status);
        }
      });
    }
  }
}
```
In order to allow users to generate data, we needed a place to store it. We used the firebase database to be able to store our data anytime a user provided a new submission with the following event listener and call to the WriteUserData function.

```
$("#post-food-button").on("click", function (event) {
  event.preventDefault();
  zipcode = $("#food-zip").val().trim();
  name = $("#food-name").val().trim();
  if (name === "") {
    name = "anonymous neighbor";
  }
  address = $("#food-address").val().trim();
  description = $("#food-desc").val().trim();
  claimed = false;
  state = "CA";
  // date stamp time
  hours = "not applicable";

  if (checkZipcodeNum(zipcode) == false || zipcode.length != 5) {
    $("#zip-warning").text("zipcode is invalid. please update and resubmit form");
  }

  else {
    $("#warning").empty()
    writeUserData(name, state, address, zipcode, description, claimed, hours);
    $("form").css("display", "none")
  }

});

// saves data to the firebase
var pathStr = "";

function writeUserData(name, state, address, zipcode, description, claimed, hours) {
  database.ref("resources/food/" + state).push({
    name: name,
    address: address,
    zipcode: zipcode,
    description: description,
    claimed: claimed,
    hours: hours
  }
  );
}

```
